This service is now obsolete. A [new web service](https://github.com/mozilla-services/tecken) has taken over the role of this service and also taken over the domain name [symbols.mozilla.org](https://symbols.mozilla.org).

~~This repository contains the Apache configuration for the
[Mozilla Symbol Server][symserv] (symbols.mozilla.org).~~

~~The server is run on [Heroku][heroku], and simply serves content from Mozilla's
public S3 bucket that holds symbol files.~~
